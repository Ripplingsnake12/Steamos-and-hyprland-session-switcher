# Want the end of window and gaming problems with tile based Hyprland?
+ Easy switching between dedicated Steam game mode (SUPER+F12)
+ Switch back to hyperland by using exit to desktop option in Steamos
+ This will add an new entry in wayland sessions called session switcher.
+ Log into this to enable auto switching.
+ NB save what ever your doing in Hyprland as you will log into New session
+ Gaming performace is awesome :)
