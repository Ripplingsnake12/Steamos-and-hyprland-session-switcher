# Want the end of window and gaming problems with tile based Hyprland?
+ Easy switching between dedicated Steam game mode (SUPER+F12)
+ Switch back to hyperland by using exit to desktop option in Steamos
+ This will add an new entry in wayland sessions called session switcher.
+ Log into this to enable auto switching.
+ NB save what ever your doing in Hyprland as you will log into New session
+ Gaming performace is awesome :)
+ If you update your hyprland config just rerun the installer to set everything up again :)
+ For some reason if you dont love great gaming performance run the uninstaller to remove all files installed and leave your hyprland.desktop file intact.
+ There is a second install .sh this is if you want to use steamos beta, steam has a habit of reseting to stable this shell script will stip it doing so.
  
# Remember and make the .sh executable
